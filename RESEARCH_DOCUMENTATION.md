```

Where αᵢ are complex probability amplitudes and |xᵢ⟩ represent basis states corresponding to antenna geometries.

**Key Innovation**: Entanglement-based parameter correlation modeling using graph structures to capture electromagnetic coupling between antenna elements.

#### Quantum Gate Operations

The algorithm implements several quantum gate operations:

### 2.2 Multi-Fidelity Optimization Framework

#### Information Fusion Mathematics

The framework employs Gaussian Process regression to fuse information across fidelities:

```
μ₃(x) = μ₂(x) + ρ₂,₃σ₂(x)/σ₃(x)[y₂(x) - μ₂(x)]
```

Where ρ₂,₃ represents the correlation coefficient between fidelity levels.

**Key Innovation**: Adaptive fidelity selection based on uncertainty, improvement potential, and computational budget allocation.

#### Fidelity Hierarchy

1. **Low Fidelity (F₁)**: Analytical models (~0.1s, 70-80% accuracy)
2. **Medium Fidelity (F₂)**: Reduced-order simulations (~10s, 85-90% accuracy)

- **Intelligent budget allocation** across fidelity levels
- **Information-theoretic acquisition functions** for optimal fidelity selection

### 2.3 Physics-Informed Neural Network Architectures

#### Maxwell Equation Integration

The neural networks incorporate electromagnetic physics as soft constraints:

```
L_physics = λ₁||∇ × E - ∂B/∂t||² + λ₂||∇ × H - ∂D/∂t||² + 
           λ₃||∇ · D - ρ||² + λ₄||∇ · B||²
```

**Key Innovation**: Graph Neural Networks with embedded Maxwell equations for topology-aware electromagnetic field prediction.
